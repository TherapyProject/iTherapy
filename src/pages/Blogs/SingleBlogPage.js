          <p class="lead">Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first
              classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
              datepickers.</p>
          <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
              you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
          <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                  Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
              bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
              Tailwind CSS.</p>

          <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
          <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
              Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
              documentation.</p>
          <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
              and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
          <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
                  guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
              to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
              purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
          <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
              you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a
                  href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/">comparison table</a> to better understand
              the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
